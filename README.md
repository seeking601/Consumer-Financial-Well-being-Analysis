Customer's Financial Well-Being Analysis

The data used in this project is mainly from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as data scrapped from different websites.

Data Source: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

Here are some preliminary results:

- Sometimes smart people make dumb decisions with their money.

- Prelimenary analysis shows that over 50% of Americans cannot enjoy life very well, based on how they manage their money. So the goal of this project is to help people out from this situation and enjoy a better life.

- People coming from different ethnic backgrounds tend to have different financial habits. Based on the results, we can provide customized coaching program, to help them create better habits, and get out of debt.

- It's also very interesting to see that materialism is not in proportion to financial wellness. For people who are more materialism and have less financial wellness score, we can recommend personalized services to help them better manage their money.

- All the results show the potential for a great data science project.
